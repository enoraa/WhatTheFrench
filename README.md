# WhatTheFrench

This website was built as final project of the Webdesign module during my Erasmus semester at University College Dublin. 
The aim was to built a website that allowed their user to learn a subject. It was obvious to choose to to create a website that allows native English speakers to learn French, giving aditional media resources that most French people can relate to.
