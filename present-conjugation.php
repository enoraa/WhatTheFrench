			<p>The French language has three groups of verbs that are easily identified: the ones finishing with -er, the ones ending with -ir, and all the other ones. In this lesson, we will focus on the present conjugation of each of the two groups, by using manger et finir. The third group will be studied in another lesson.</p>
			<div>
				<p>The first group is the easiest: you take away -er and instead add the correct ending depending on who the subject is. But don't forget that if they finish with -yer, the "y" becomes an "i".</p>
				<table class="conjtables">
					<tr>
						<th>Pronom</th>
						<th>Verbe</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Je</td>
						<td>Mang<span>e</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Tu</td>
						<td>Mang<span>es</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Il/Elle/On</td>
						<td>Mang<span>e</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Nous</td>
						<td>Mang<span>ons</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Vous</td>
						<td>Mang<span>ez</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Ils</td>
						<td>Mang<span>ent</span></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>Perfect! Now you know how to conjugate all verbs of the first group (except aller, but that irregular verb is for another lesson)</p>
				<p>Now let's take a look at the second group of words. Surprisingly, it works the same as the first group, only with other endings..</p>
				<table class="conjtables">
					<tr>
						<th>Pronom</th>
						<th>Verbe</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Je</td>
						<td>Fin<span>is</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Tu</td>
						<td>Fin<span>is</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Il/Elle/On</td>
						<td>Fin<span>it</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Nous</td>
						<td>Fin<span>issons</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Vous</td>
						<td>Fin<span>issez</span></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Ils</td>
						<td>Fin<span>issent</span></td>
					</tr>

				<p>You are now all set to use first and second group verbs in French. Who said learning French would be difficult?</p>
